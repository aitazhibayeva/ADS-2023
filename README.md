Algorithms and data structure for important data in solving various laboratory tasks~

This repository is designed to teach efficient use of data structures and algorithms to solve
problems. To study the logical relationship between data structures associated with a
problem and the physical representation. Topics include introduction to algorithms and data
organisation, arrays, stacks, queues, single and double linked lists, trees, graphs, internal
sorting, hashing, and heap structures. Hands-on exercises are required.
Goals:
Develop computer programming and debugging skills in building projects with abstract
data types.
- to solve problems using some existing (or developing new) algorithms or data
structures
- analyse algorithms in terms of efficiency, complexity etc.
- develop implementation skills in algorithms and data structures
